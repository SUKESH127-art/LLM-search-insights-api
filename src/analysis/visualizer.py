    Analyze the following text, which is a summary of web search results for a specific query.
    Your task is to identify the top 5 most prominent brands mentioned.

    You must perform the following steps:
    1.  **Identify Brands**: Scan the text to find all mentioned brand names.
    2.  **Count Mentions**: Tally the number of times each brand is mentioned.
    3.  **Assess Prominence**: Evaluate the prominence of each mention. Brands mentioned earlier, in headlines, or as primary recommendations are more prominent.
    4.  **Calculate Visibility Score**: Based on a combination of mention count and prominence, calculate a 'visibility_score' for each brand on a scale of 1 to 100.
    5.  **Rank Brands**: Rank the top 5 brands from 1 to 5 based on their score.
    6.  **Explain Methodology**: Briefly (1-2 sentences) explain the specific factors you used from the text to determine the scores. For example: "Scores were based on mention frequency and prominence in lists of 'best' brands."

    Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly follows this structure:
    {{
      "top_5_brands": ["Brand A", "Brand B", ...],
      "brand_scores": [
        {{ "brand_name": "Brand A", "visibility_score": 95, "rank": 1, "mentions": 8 }},
        {{ "brand_name": "Brand B", "visibility_score": 90, "rank": 2, "mentions": 6 }},
        ...
      ],
      "methodology_explanation": "Your explanation here."
